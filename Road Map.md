#Road Map
In priority order (feel free to reorder.)

###etherre.al registration
- [ ] **ID creation** DApp that lets any user register their keys in the ID registry, 
- [ ] **registry** -> users keys maped to their name, nick name, address etc <- this is the public record part of the system
- [ ] **OpenID** allow users to register with an OAuth or OpenID account in order to save them the typing of the information
- [ ] **Leverage OpenPGP** If a user has an OpenPGP certificate, import it from https://sks-keyservers.net/i/ and if any signer of her certificate is a member already, then ask her to validate the signature


###etherre.al registration
- [ ] **ID creation** DApp that lets any user register their keys in the ID registry,

    - [ ] Sort these ID contracts into geographicl groups            
  
###Sortition  
- [ ]  search through regestry and creat geographical groups
- [ ]  return 3 random

######boot strap hack
- [ ]  use FoaF or for long range verification using Firefox-Hello
					- [ ] Overseeyer creats the session and 

###VouchSafe					
  - [ ] Information is accessed by ring signature -> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ring_signature
  - [ ] generate QR-Code to avoid typing when validating IDs
  - [ ] verification system key signing

  - [ ] reporting, mechanism
  - [ ] add transaction with evaluation - any TX on the blockchain can be referenced and evaluated as long as the user has taken part in it


####Dont know where to put.
			- [ ] sort users by gographical location (and distance they are prepaired to travel.)
			- [ ] FoaF (Friend of a friend) network / WoT (Web of Trust) folowing the read write web moddel
					Not a core part of etherre.al but it will speed addoption
	
####App / HTML / Wisper / Whatever stuf that can be kept out of contracts

  - [ ] Instruction to users in interface for what to do.  {qr code and the like}
  - 
  

#House Keeping#
- [ ] Create the framework consultaiton process on http://dapp.etherre.al <<Dows not exist yet 
- [ ] Populate Github issues
